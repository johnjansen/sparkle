# Sparkle CMS


*TODO:* Build a CMS which can be included into a web app, such that a developer can quickly add self management facilities to any web app. This functionality is intended to allow the quick creation and editing of editorial pages, content and / or sections. I've chosen Crystal because its fresh ground, fast and enjoyable to use.

*HISTORY:* I've built several commercial CMS systems before, enough that i have a rough plan and an idea of the architecture. Im not trying to build a *wordpress* or *jekyll* or *name_any_existing_system*, the idea is to consider the problem with fresh eyes and develop to answer the identified needs.

*TIMELINE:* I'm very busy, so i dont know how much time i will get on this project. Having said that, i'd like to write some design documents (in some form) and start creating action point (maybe as tickets). If things come off the way im envisaging, then anyone will be welcome to contribute / pickup tickets and implement functionality.

*STATUS:* Unstarted
